IXNTilePuzzle
====================

A simple square `UIView` for making a simple sliding puzzle. I made this as a learning process, which maybe will help others as well. There are parts that I adopt from SliderPuzzleDemo by Joshua Newnham. If there's any advices or improvements, please do make a pull request!

*Update 2014:* I rewrote the class to practice TDD for making the tile board model. I've updated the code to support iOS 7.

##Usage

Please download the repository and check the sample code for usage.
