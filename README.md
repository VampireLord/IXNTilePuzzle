IXNTilePuzzle
====================

A simple square uiview for making a simple sliding puzzle. I made this as a learning resource, to every beginner iOS developers, including myself. There are parts that i adopt from SliderPuzzleDemo by Joshua Newnham. If there's any advices, or improvements, please don't hesitate to improve it.

*Update 2014*
I rewrote the class to practice TDD for making the tile board model. I've updated the code to support iOS 7.
